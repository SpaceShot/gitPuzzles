# gitPuzzles
Git Puzzles are small problems that will help you learn to use Git comfortably

## master branch
In this branch, we have a File > New Project of an ASP.NET Core Web API project.  It has simply been committed as is, with a .gitignore toremove most unnecessary cruft.
Many of the puzzles will work with this as a base.
